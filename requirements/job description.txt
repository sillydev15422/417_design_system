Hello, we're a graphic design company looking to get a system which can run the whole of our business such as customer portals and staff accounts.
Overview:
We need a customer portal where customers can communicate with their designer and post their graphic design requests. This should link in with our employee system where which will need to be created at the same time.
How the system should work:
Customers should be able to manage their accounts and submit design requests to our team. When they submit their design it should automatically be added to the next available employees schedule. Once the employee completes the task they should be able to send it back to the customer.
Example companies:
Please look at the example companies provided to see how it works as this is what we would like.
https://penji.co and nlc.com
We would like it built on this template:
DeskApp but with the changes that we have on our guidance brief. https://themewagon.com/themes/free-responsive-bootstrap-4-html5-admin-dashboard-template-
deskapp/
What we need from you as the developer:
1.Design and develop our systems following the brief. 2.Assistance with the launch and hosting (we will pay the hosting company directly for this but need help on finding the right one)
3. Security - adding layers of security so our platform remains protected.
4. Adding designer features like our competitors have e.g click to leave feedback on designs, manage multiple projects on the go, add in additional team members.
How will this work with our business model:
Our company website is built on Wix. We need this app to be run separately and have the url addresses for login pages etc so when the customer clicks login on our website it redirects them to the system.
Completion time: We are looking to have this done within 30 days.
